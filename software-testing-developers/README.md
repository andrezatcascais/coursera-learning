***About this Course***
Code and run software tests websites without installing anything!

This course is designed for learners who have some experience with JavaScript but a novice to software testing. The modules in this course covers the fundamentals of testing with Jest; popular testing paradigms like test-driven development, behavior-driven development, user accepting testing, etc.; and commonly used tools like JMeter, Postman, and Cucumber.

To allow for a truly hands-on, self-paced learning experience, this course is video-free. Assignments contain short explanations with images and runnable code examples with suggested edits to explore code examples further, building a deeper understanding by doing. Youâ€™ll benefit from instant feedback from a variety of assessment items along the way, gently progressing from quick understanding checks (multiple choice, fill in the blank, and un-scrambling code blocks) to slowly building features, resulting in large coding projects at the end of the course.

**Course Learning Objectives:**

* Write unit tests with Jest
* Develop software using test-driven development
* Test APIs with Postman
* Test software with popular tools such as JMeter, Selenium, and Cucumber
